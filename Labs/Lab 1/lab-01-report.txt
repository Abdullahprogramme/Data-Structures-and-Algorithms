For "TextBufferArray" I placed the stopwatch right before inserting the text and checked the elapsed time after inserting the letter 'Y'.
The time recorded was 0.0020057 seconds. On another instant it was 0.0023709 seconds.

For "TextBufferList" I placed the stopwatch right before inserting the text and checked the elapsed time after inserting the letter 'Y'.
The time recorded was 0.0007736 seconds. On another instant it was 0.0032019 seconds.

This shows the Stack made from array is taking around more than 200% time than the stack made from LinkList. On the second attempt it was around 74% faster.
In general this shows that linked list is much faster than the array.
